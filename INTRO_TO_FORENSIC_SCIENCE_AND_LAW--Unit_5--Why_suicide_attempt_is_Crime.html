<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Why suicide attempt is Crime</h1><br/>Comes under the section<br />• IPC Sec 309<br />• MH Act Sec 115<br /><br />• A life with full control over it is supposedly guranteed Constitution. The conflixt however is that Liberty is guaranteed to an individual but no such right is given to end his/her life with own will<br />• Court held that right to die cannot be interpreted from right to life under Article 21<br />• Right to life is natural right embodied in Article 21 but suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of file and therefore is incompatible and inconsitent with concept of right to life<br /><br /></div>
